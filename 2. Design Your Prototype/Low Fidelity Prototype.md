    * Logo (placeholder text)
    * Navigation bar with links to "About Me," "Skills," "Projects," and "Contact" sections.
* **Hero Section:**
    * Large text introducing yourself and your profession (e.g., "Hi, I'm [Your Name]! I'm a passionate [Your Profession].")
    * Optional: Short bio or call to action button.
* **About Me Section:**
    * Title: "About Me"
    * Text box with your personal introduction, professional background, and interests.

    * List of your skills with icons or visual representations.
    * Optional: Progress bars or stars to indicate proficiency levels (if applicable).
* **Projects Section:**
    * Title: "Projects"
    * Grid layout displaying each project with:
        * Project title
        * Short description
        * Image thumbnail or icon
        * Optional: Link to live demo or code repository (represented as text)

**Additional Notes:**

* The prototype focuses on the content and layout structure, not the visual design.
* Each section can be represented by a rectangle with a brief description of its content.
* Arrows indicate the flow of navigation between sections.
* You can use drawing tools, paper mockups, or online wireframing tools to create this prototype.

Remember, this is a low-fidelity prototype, so the focus is on functionality and basic layout, not aesthetics.
