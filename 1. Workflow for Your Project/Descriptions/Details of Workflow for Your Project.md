**Explanation:**

1. **Project Initiation:** The project begins with defining the goals, target audience, and desired features for the website.
2. **Define Website Content:** This step involves gathering and preparing content for various sections (About Me, Skills, Projects, Contact). This includes writing descriptions, selecting visuals, and preparing project details.
3. **Design Layout & Visuals:** This stage focuses on creating the website's visual identity, including choosing color schemes, fonts, and overall layout for each section.
4. **Develop Front-end (HTML, CSS, JS):** The website's user interface is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements (if needed).
5. **Integrate Functionality (Optional):** This step involves adding features like a contact form, portfolio management system, or social media integration (if desired).
6. **Test & Debug on Different Devices:** Thorough testing is crucial to ensure the website functions correctly and displays well across various browsers and devices.
7. **Deploy Website (Optional):** If not using a website builder, the website files are uploaded to a web hosting platform to make it publicly accessible.
8. **Maintenance & Updates:** The website requires ongoing maintenance to update content, fix bugs, and ensure security, especially if using a contact form or other interactive elements.
